				<h2>Japan: Weather & when to go</h2>
				<h3>When is the best time of year to visit Japan?</h3>
				<p class="bold">Weather patterns and temperatures vary across the country but generally, the best time to visit Japan is spring (March & April) or autumn (October & November), when days are sunny and dry. During the summer months (May to September), the cities are hot and humid, with heavy rainfall occurring across the country in June & July, except for Hokkaido. In winter, days are cool and crisp, with heavy snowfall in Hokkaido and the Japanese Alps. </p>
				
				<h2>Weather overview</h2>
				<p>Japan is a year round destination, with four distinct seasons that offer something for everyone.</p>

				<p>Skiers and snowboarders in search of the perfect powder stash are drawn to Japan’s mountain regions during winter, which also attract hikers during the summer months.</p>

				<p>Further south, the beaches of the southern islands are also busy during summer thanks to high sea and air temperatures.</p>

				<p>In spring and autumn, pleasant temperatures combine with the natural beauty of ‘sakura’ (cherry blossom season) and ‘koyo’ (autumn leaf viewing) to make these seasons an especially popular time to visit Japan.</p>

				<h4>Honshu</h4>
				<p>Weather conditions and temperatures vary across Japan's main island of Honshu.</p>
				<p>Northern Honshu and the Japanese Alps experience cooler temperatures (avg temp: 0°C) and heavy snowfall during the winter months, whilst the southern and western regions have milder winters (avg temp: 4 - 5°C) but are prone to hot and humid summers, especially in the main cities of Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka with temperatures pushing the mercury up to 35°C on some days. </p>
				<p>June is the wettest month of the year across Honshu, with tropical showers occurring until early July.</p>
				<p>In terms of temperature and weather conditions, spring and autumn are typically the most pleasant times of the year to visit Honshu. During April, the cherry blossom advances from Hiroshima, in the south, to the higher altitudes of Takayama and the Japan Alps by the end of the month; and conversely, the autumn colours work their way down from the mountains in early October to Kyoto and southern regions by late November.</p>
				<h4> Northern Honshu</h4>
				<p>NORTHERN HONSHU is one of one of the more isolated and unspoiled parts of Japan. Known to Japanese as Tohuku, it embraces Aomori, Iwate, Akita, Yamagata, Miyagi, and Fukushima prefectures and is known for heavy snows, strong winds, and scenic beauty. Most of the region is covered by mountains and large tracts of wilderness. There are three national parks, and seven quasi national parks but few large cities.</p>

				<p>Northern Honshu is also known for its interesting folk customs and festivals and large number of hot springs, some of which have traditionally been places where men and women bathed together. The people here are regarded as friendly but unsophisticated. Few non-Japanese travel around this area and foreign visitors should be prepared for few English speakers.</p>
